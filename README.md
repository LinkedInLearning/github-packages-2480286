Almost every software developer uses dependencies to extend or accelerate the development process. GitHub Packages is a software package hosting service that allows you to host your software packages privately or publicly and use packages as dependencies in your projects. GitHub Packages combines your source code and packages in one place to provide integrated permissions management and billing, so you can centralize your software development on GitHub.
In this course, instructor Carlos Solís explains how to use GitHub packages to create and distribute secure and reliable software packages. He shows how to work with GitHub tools, create automated workflows, and shares tips and tricks to monetize and build communities around your software package. If you’re a developer or DevOps engineer looking to create and host software packages using a more secure, reliable, and centralized platform, check out this course.
